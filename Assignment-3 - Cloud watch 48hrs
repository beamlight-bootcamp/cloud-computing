Title - Create aws lambda function which will execute every 48hrs to create an instance
Create an AWS Lambda function called "ec2time-function" that will execute every 48 hours to create an instance.
Create an IAM role that grants the necessary permissions to create an ec2 instance and handle CloudWatch requests. Assign this role to the Lambda function.
Open the CloudWatch service in the AWS Management Console.
Click on "Rules" in the left navigation pane.
Click on "Create rule" to create a new CloudWatch Events rule.
Configure the rule to run on a schedule of "Fixed rate of" 48 hours.
Specify the Lambda function "ec2time-function" as the target for the rule.
Provide a name for the rule and save it.
Test the setup by monitoring the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function and verifying that a new ec2 instance is created every 48 hours.
